It's an app where DJ's can post their setlist they plan on playing that night and the individul users can collaborate and vote on songs from that setlist they want to hear sooner. I also wanted to make the artists set a little easier so instead of just \"feeling the room\", they can actually look at real-time statistics and see what people want to hear.",
